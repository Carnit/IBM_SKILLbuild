                        less than the two degrees C goal established at the Paris Agreement, the EU must reduce their CO
                        2 emissions by 80% by 2030.”</p>

                    <p>The Philippines’ lead negotiator Yeb Sano addressed the opening session of the UN climate summit
                        in Warsaw in November 2013. In this emotional and powerful climate change speech he called for
                        urgent action to prevent a repeat of the devastating storm that hit parts of the Philippines.

            <h2>Fast Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere, as of May 2022, is the highest it has
                    been in human history.</li>
                <li>2023 was the hottest year on record, with global temperatures 2.12 degrees F (1.18 degrees C) warmer
                    than the 20th-century average.</li>
                <li>As much as 20 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to
                    deforestation.</li>
                <li>Tropical forests are effective at storing carbon and could provide at least a third of the
                    mitigation action needed to prevent the worst climate change scenarios.</li>
                <li>Scaling up natural climate solutions, such as restoring degraded forests, could create as many as 20
                    million new jobs.</li>
                <li>Average global temperatures in July 2023 were higher than any other month on record.</li>
                <li>As many as 3.6 billion people live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.</li>
                <li>Mangroves hold significant carbon stocks, and their destruction releases carbon into the atmosphere.
                </li>
                <li>Conserving ecosystems, like mangroves, can provide cost-effective flood protection benefits
                    exceeding US$ 65 billion per year.</li>
                <li>One hundred ninety-three countries and the European Union have ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement to
                    limit global warming and adapt to climate change, including protecting nature.</li>
