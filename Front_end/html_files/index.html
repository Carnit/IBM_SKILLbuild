                <h2>Welcome to Climate Awareness</h2>
                <p>Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health. It affects the physical environment as
                    well as all aspects of both natural and human systems â€“ including social and economic conditions. As
                    climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed,
                    including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts, and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards
                    affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases,
                    the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies.</p>
